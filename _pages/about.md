I am currently a postdoc associate at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART). I earned my Ph.D. in Transportation from MIT in 2024 and completed dual Master's degrees in City Planning and Transportation at MIT in 2021, advised by Prof. Jinhua Zhao [Jinhua Zhao](https://dusp.mit.edu/people/jinhua-zhao). Prior to my time at MIT, I obtained dual Bachelor's degrees in Urban Management and Economics from Peking University.

My research area is the intersection of **Causal Inference**, **Urban Computing**, and **Travel Decisions**:

* **Causal Inference, Transportation Economics and Policy**: Leveraging advanced causal inference methods for the assessment of emerging transportation tools like congestion pricing, EV charging infrastructure, and teleworking on mobility, environment, economy, and social equity.
* **Urban Computing and Machine Learning**: Developing machine learning algorithms to predict and nudge travel behaviors; developing bias-mitigation methods to enhance fairness and equity in machine learning algorithms.
* **Travel Decisions and Urban Network**: Combining statistical modeling, deep learning computation, and network theory for the modeling and analysis of individual travel decisions and urban networks.
<!-- My research focuses on (1) causal inference in urban economics and transportation and (2) enhancing machine learning fairness in transportation planning and policy-making.  My previous research involves using causal inference methods to assess the impacts of emerging transportation tools like congestion pricing, EV charging infrastructure, and teleworking on mobility, environment, economy, and social equity. I am also committed to developing bias-mitigation algorithms to enhance fairness and equity in travel behavior analysis and demand prediction. -->
